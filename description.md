Data Lakehuse is a new data management paradigm that leverages the capabilites of data lakes and data warehouses. This adjuncture will allow **BI Users** and **Data Scientists** to work on the same sources. The data lakehouse is benefitted with schema enforcement and governance from data warehouse and with diverse data types from data lakes.

* Data Warehouse: It is a storage repository that holds structured data and helps to connect and perform analysis on that data. Raw data passess through many data transformation pipelines that integrates and cleans the data before performing any analysis on it. Data is usually housed in files and folder in data warehouses.

* Data Lake: It is also a storage repository that can accomodate all kinds of data, like a lake which can accommodate multiple tributaries. Data lakes can store structured, semi- structured and un-structured data like images, documents, logs, etc. It is big, fast and cost-effective and thus increase analytic performance. A unique identifier, with some metadata information, is tagged with each data element thus removing the need of schema approach.

# Why to Use the Data Lakehouse?

<p style="text-align: left;">
Multiple data warehouses and a big data lake are still used parallelly in many organizations resulting in data duplication between the two with data transformation and management pipelines overhead, initiating towards the growth of data lakehouse.
  
Now that we have learned much about data warehouse and data lakes and their usage resulting to the exploration data lakehouse to reduce these overheads. Let's explore more about data lakehouse. 

### Features of Data Lakehouse

Ben played the **Data Scientists**,

<br>

In terms of Data Jobs, Ben played the **role of Data Architect**, Jonny played the **role of Data Engineer** and Cris was **the Data Scientist**.

# So, How these subfields are different?



* **Data Architect**

A Data Architect provides the blueprint for Data Management Systems. He's responsible for understanding the business objective and existing data infrastructure, and then work out a plan for integrating, centralizing, and maintaining all the data, shaping the data architecture or pipelines as per the requirements and standards.
<br>
<br>

* **Data Engineer**

A Data Engineer develop, construct, test, and maintain architectures. As a hardcore engineer, they work along with a Data Architect to develop such high-performance data pipelines and work on Data reliability, efficiency, and quality. In short, He deals with gathering the data and process them.
<br>
<br>

* **Data Scientist**
<img src="images\DS.png" alt="drawing" width="200" style="float: right"/>

A Data Scientist uses the pipelines or architectures designed by Data Engineer and tries to extract valuable insights from the data. He's more mathematically inclined, usually trained in areas like Machine Learning, Statistics, and some hardcore domains like 
Text Analytics(NLP), Computer Vision(CV) etc.

# Closing Remark

<p style="text-align: left;">

Given above is an interpretation of what we have observed while researching at the time of writing this article. We tried to explore some well known but misunderstood Job Profiles in the field of Data.

Restating, Data is everywhere. Every company wants a guy who can bring the potential out of these Data that can change the world we are looking at right now. Pursue the field that you love and have a passion for, irrespective of its scope and salary, because, in the end, it'll bring immense pleasure and satisfaction. And if you're good with your field, then there will be demand and you'll grow.
